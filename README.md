# dataset-gradientDescent

## Part 1: 
### The Libararies it uses are as follows
- Pandas
- sklearn known as Scikit Learn
- matplotlib
- numpy
- ssl

### How to use part1.py
Once you have all the necessary libraries installed, you can run the code in your favorite python IDE and you should get 4 plots displayed one after the other just close them to continue until you have the terminal/console print out results of the gradient descent to get MSE of both training and test sets and R2 for test set.

That should be all that was required in part 1.

## Part 2:
### The Libararies it uses are as follows
- Pandas
- sklearn known as Scikit Learn
- matplotlib
- numpy
- ssl

### How to use part1.py
Similar to Part 1 you can run the code in your favorite python IDE and you should get 1 plot displayed just close it to continue until you have the terminal/console print out results of the SDGRegressor model to get MSE of both training and test sets and R2 both test set and training set.

That should be all that was required in part 2.

## About the Dataset Auto MPG
1. Title: Auto-Mpg Data

2. Sources:
   (a) Origin:  This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is
                maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. The dataset was 
                used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition.
   (c) Date: July 7, 1993

3. Past Usage:
    -  See 2b (above)
    -  Quinlan,R. (1993). Combining Instance-Based and Model-Based Learning.
       In Proceedings on the Tenth International Conference of Machine 
       Learning, 236-243, University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Morgan
       Kaufmann.

4. Relevant Information:

   This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in
   the StatLib library.  In line with the use by Ross Quinlan (1993) in
   predicting the attribute "mpg", 8 of the original instances were removed 
   because they had unknown values for the "mpg" attribute.  The original 
   dataset is available in the file "auto-mpg.data-original".

   "The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon,
    to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous
    attributes." (Quinlan, 1993)

5. Number of Instances: 398

6. Number of Attributes: 9 including the class attribute

7. Attribute Information:

    1. mpg:           continuous
    2. cylinders:     multi-valued discrete
    3. displacement:  continuous
    4. horsepower:    continuous
    5. weight:        continuous
    6. acceleration:  continuous
    7. model year:    multi-valued discrete
    8. origin:        multi-valued discrete
    9. car name:      string (unique for each instance)

8. Missing Attribute Values:  horsepower has 6 missing values
